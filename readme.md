The strategies proposed by us and the professor were compared.                                                                                |                   [Claudio Savelli](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli)                  |                                                                            [Folder](https://github.com/LucaCatalano13/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main/Laboratories/LAB02)                                                                           |

A final solution was proposed based on Island Segregation.                                                                                |                   [Claudio Savelli](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli) [Florentin Udrea](https://github.com/florentin1304)                  |                                                                            [Folder](https://github.com/LucaCatalano13/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main/Laboratories/LAB09)

|        *Lab 10*        | The objective of this laboratory was to create a TicTacToe player agent using some reinforcement learning algorithm. The Q-Learning algorithm was used. The training was done both against a random player (ensuring exploration from the opponent side) and an informed player. The agent was then tested against these two and other versions of the same trained agent.|   |[Folder](https://github.com/LucaCatalano13/Computational-Intelligence/tree/main/Laboratories/LAB10)

## Disclaimer 

Even though most of the code presented in this repo has been produced by the authors, or sometimes by the Professor during lectures, some pieces have been eventually developed through the help provided by several discussions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and by AI tools like [ChatGPT (version 3.5)](https://chat.openai.com). These have represented a great starting point for creating our own custom solutions!
